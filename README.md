### Project Description
Fake online voting machines are systems designed to manipulate or compromise the integrity of electronic voting processes. These systems can be used to cast fraudulent votes, alter vote counts, or disrupt the voting process altogether.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
A website that misattributes votes to another candidate, whether intentionally or due to vulnerabilities, poses significant problems, 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution that is not asked by anyone for a fake voting machine is likely a secure and transparent voting system that prevents tampering and ensures the accuracy of votes.
